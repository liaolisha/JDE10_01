I am Liao Lisha
Here is my favorite song
New Soul
I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take
But since I came here, felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake
La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la
La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la la
La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la
La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la la
See I'm a young soul in this very strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout what is true and fake
But why all this hate? Try to communicate
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make
La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la
La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la la
La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la
